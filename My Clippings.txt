Some babies showed signs of distress as soon as their mother left. When she returned, these babies would be temporarily soothed and stop crying but then angrily push the mother away and begin crying again. Ainsworth called these babies “anxiously attached.” Another group of babies cried when their mother left but stopped as soon as she returned. They quickly resumed playing. These were the “securely attached” babies.

Esther Perel, your visionary work paved the way for this book. From our first conversation about my parents, to our chat about having children, you’ve added depth, complexity, and wisdom to my life.
